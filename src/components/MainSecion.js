        I'm a software engineer, who focuses on full-stack web development. I
        like to solve problems by downsizing big ones into small portions that
        make them solvable. I have a passion for building excellent Websites
        that improve clientsâ€™ work. I try to keep up with security and best
        practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.
